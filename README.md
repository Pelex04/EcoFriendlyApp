Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Android Studio (latest version)
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
Android Emulator or Physical Device (Android 6.0+)
Firebase Project with enabled Authentication, Firestore, and Storage

Installation

Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url> 


Set Up Firebase:

Create a Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com.
Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Storage in the Firebase Console.
Upgrade to the Blaze plan (required for Storage) by linking a Cloud Billing account in Project Settings > Upgrade. Note: The billing account cannot be deleted but can be closed to avoid charges if within the free tier.
Download google-services.json and place it in app/.


Configure Keystore:

Create a keystore using keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore mynewkeystore.keystore -alias mynewalias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 (store securely with chosen password and alias).
Update app/build.gradle with the keystore path, password, and alias under signingConfigs.


Add Dependencies:

In app/build.gradle, include:implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:33.5.0')
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth-ktx'
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore-ktx'
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-storage-ktx'
implementation 'org.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:6.1.18'
implementation "com.google.accompanist:accompanist-permissions:0.34.0"


Sync the project.


Permissions:

Update AndroidManifest.xml with:<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />




Build the App:

Open Android Studio, load the project, and sync Gradle.
Generate a signed APK: Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK, using your keystore.
Install the app-release.apk on a device/emulator.



Usage

Dashboard: View the map, tap markers for coordinates, and navigate to other screens.
Report: Select a title, enter description and location, upload a photo, and submit. Requires internet for photo uploads.
Plans: Access eco tips (e.g., "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle") and encouraging messages (e.g., "Every small step helps!").
Profile: View and edit user name and profile details, synced with Firebase.
Offline: Map works offline after caching tiles while online.

Known Issues and Fixes

Map Sizing: If the map doesnâ€™t fit, adjust the height in DashboardScreen (e.g., 400.dp) or recalculate availableHeight.
Photo Upload: Ensure a billing account is linked for Firebase Storage. Verify photoUri and storage rules (allow write: if request.auth != null;).
Network Dependency: Cache tiles offline by pre-loading while online or use a static map image as a fallback.

Troubleshooting

Map Not Loading: Check internet or pre-cache tiles. Use adb logcat for errors.
Photo Upload Fails: Confirm photoUri is valid, check Firebase Storage rules, and ensure Blaze plan is active.
Installation Errors: Verify minSdk = 23 and targetSdk = 35 in build.gradle, and use a correct keystore.
Profile Edit Issues: Ensure Firebase Authentication is initialized and user is signed in.
